# Portfolio Project
## Analysis of Violent Crime in New York City

This project involves the systematic formulation of hypotheses and a study of the temporal and spatial distribution of five years of violent crimes in New York City using exploratory data analysis techniques and statistical methods to help law enforcement agencies make better decisions for the efficacious reduction of crime.

The statistical methods used to make a recommendation for developing an effective crime prevention strategy include:

* Frequency distribution, charts, and maps to see the frequency of crimes in New York City by type of offense, time of day, by season, and how crimes are spread out spatially on a map to identify hotspots.

* Calculate and interpret the relationship between increased police patrols and crimes in each borough using the paired t-test to determine if an increase in policing activities will influence crime rates.

* Produce a linear regression model against a training crime dataset and compare the predicted counts against the actual counts on a plot to validate the model.
